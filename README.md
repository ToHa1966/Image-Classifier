# Creating an Image Classifier
This project is part of the Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program.

### Project Status
Completed

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to acquire skills in developing an AI application

## Project Description
In this project an image classifier is built to recognize different species of flowers. The image dataset is loaded and preprocessed, the classifier is built using an existing model, the classifier is trained to predict image content and the accuracy is measured. This application can be trained on any set of labeled images.
